            <div class="right">At the heart of the PepsiCo Foundation is our belief in the potential possessed by the people and communities we serve. There are far too many communities around the world, however, that are systemically excluded from access to the essential resources they need to grow, prosper and thrive — like nutritious food, safe water and economic opportunity. That is why the PepsiCo Foundation’s work focuses on the creation of sustainable and innovative solutions to these critical socioeconomic issues. We know that by alleviating the stress and strain of these barriers, we come one step closer to creating a more equitable world for all. </div>
